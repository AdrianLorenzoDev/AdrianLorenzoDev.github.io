Since the day I decided to make my personal webpage, I really wanted to share things about myself. But I did not want to be boring. I wanted to express things like a I would do if I was in front of everyone that wanted to talk to me. That is why I decided to make this blog section.

This is only the first commit, but with a lot of connotations and intentions. Feel free to email me if you need help. I will attach to this blog entry my social media profiles if you want to contact me in these places too.
